# RainSimulation
This project contains a Processing sketch, which produces an interactive animation. The animation shows raindrops falling into the pool. The user affects how many drops will fall in with how loud they are and how much they move in front of the camera. The goal is to "still" the animation, to stop, be quiet and just listen to the plops.
