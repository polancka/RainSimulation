# RainSimulation
This project contains a Processing sketch, which produces an interactive animation. The animation shows raindrops falling into the pool. The user affects how many drops will fall in with how loud they are and how much they move in front of the camera. The goal is to "still" the animation, to stop, be quiet and just listen to the plops. 

## Running the sketch 
For runing this sketch you will need two libraries: 
- processing.video.* (za procesiranje videa)
- ddf.minim.* (za procesiranje zvoka)

The program will acces the camera on your device for the time of animation runnning. Run this file as any other Processing sketch. 
Make sure to include the data directory.

## Disclaimer
The code for the ripple effect motion was influenced by open source solutions on OpenProcessing.
